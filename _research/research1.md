## Overview
As gentrification transforms urban communities, the cultural heritage and lived experiences of areas like Harlem, New York, are at risk of being lost. **Community History Through AR** is an **Augmented Reality (AR)** application designed to preserve the historical and cultural significance of the Harlem region while fostering civic engagement. 

The project empowers residents to rediscover their community’s history by interacting with AR-enhanced narratives of landmarks, historical buildings, and community stories. The application also integrates features inspired by the **Emoverse** platform, enabling users to leave AR assets, comments, and stories at various locations.

The project explores the following questions:  
1. How can AR be effectively utilized to preserve community history?  
2. What are the key UI/UX design considerations for developing a community-centered AR application?

## Responsibilities
- Conducted **formative studies** to understand the historical context and current challenges of Harlem through field research, archival analysis, and community engagement with Harlem residents.  
- Collaborated with the **[NSF Center for Smart Streetscapes](https://smartstreetscapes.cs.columbia.edu)** and the 125th Street Business Improvement District to ensure the application aligns with community needs and objectives.  
- Designed **multi-layered wireframes** using Figma, Adobe Illustrator, and Balsamiq, integrating features such as:  
  - **Heatmap functionality** similar to Snapchat’s heatmaps for storytelling and locating key landmarks.  
  - Interactive maps focusing on themes like **health, safety, history, and art** in Harlem.  
- Created 3D models of significant historic buildings using **Blender** and prototyped AR features in **Unity**, enabling users to visualize how buildings have changed over time.  
- Proposed integrating **[Emoverse](**, where users can leave comments, stories, or AR objects for others to interact with, building a sense of shared history and connection.  
- Led a **pilot study** with 10 participants using a beta mobile application to gather feedback on AR functionalities and UI/UX design.

## Key Outcomes
- Developed a prototype in **Figma** showcasing core application features, such as heatmaps, AR storytelling, and user interactions.  
- Built a beta AR prototype that allows users to view historical narratives and visual changes in landmarks by pointing their phone cameras at specific locations.  
- Collected valuable insights through pilot studies, emphasizing AR’s potential for bridging physical spaces with their historical narratives while identifying UI/UX improvements.  
- Established a foundation for community engagement by incorporating feedback from Harlem residents and local organizations.

## Technologies and Tools
- **Design:** Figma, Adobe Illustrator, Balsamiq for wireframes; Blender for 3D modeling.  
- **Development:** Unity for AR feature development and prototyping.  
- **Planned Technologies:** AR SDKs (e.g., ARCore, Vuforia) for real-time AR asset placement; scalable database systems for user-generated content.  

---

## Future Scope
- Refine AR features to enhance **user experience**, focusing on ease of navigation, accessibility, and interactive storytelling.  
- Incorporate **new functionalities**, such as the ability to customize AR assets and leave location-specific comments or stories, fostering a sense of community engagement.  
- Address technical challenges identified during the pilot study and integrate advanced features like **community heatmaps** and real-time user interactions.  
- Conduct formal user studies with Harlem residents to guide iterative development and ensure the platform aligns with their needs.  
- Publish findings in a research paper exploring the intersection of AR technology and cultural preservation, highlighting its potential impact.
