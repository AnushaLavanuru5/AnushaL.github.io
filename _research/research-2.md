Overview
---
**VISER-POLXR** is an **Extended Reality (XR)** platform developed to revolutionize the analysis of polarimetric geospatial datasets. The project integrates **3D geospatial visualization** with cutting-edge AR/VR technologies, enabling researchers to explore and analyze complex ice-penetrating radar data in immersive environments.

The application allows users to interact with digital twins of ice shelves, navigate flightlines, and visualize radargrams in geospatial context, providing unparalleled insights into polar environments. VISER-POLXR aims to bridge the gap between traditional data analysis and collaborative XR-based research.

This project is being done at [CGUI lab](https://graphics.cs.columbia.edu/home) in collaboration with [Lamont doherty earth observatory](https://lamont.columbia.edu/).
