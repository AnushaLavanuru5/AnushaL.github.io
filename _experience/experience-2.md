Responsibilities

In collaboration with community stakeholders, I worked on an **Augmented Reality (AR)** application to preserve the cultural and historical significance of the Harlem region. The project combined **community storytelling** with modern AR technologies to enhance civic engagement.

- Conducted **field studies** and **archival research** to identify key landmarks and cultural narratives.
- Designed **multi-layered wireframes** in Figma to prototype storytelling features and interactive heatmaps.
- Prototyped AR features in Unity, allowing users to leave comments, AR assets, and stories tied to locations.
- Facilitated pilot studies to collect user feedback, refining the application based on community input.

Impact

The project empowered local residents to preserve their cultural heritage and enabled an immersive, educational platform for discovering Harlemâ€™s rich history.
