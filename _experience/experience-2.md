### **Research Assistant**  
**Columbia University – Computer Graphics and User Interfaces Lab**  
*May 2024 – Present*

As a Research Assistant, I contributed to projects at the intersection of **geospatial data visualization** and **Extended Reality (XR)** technologies. My work focused on creating immersive, multi-user environments for exploring polarimetric datasets and fostering collaborative scientific analysis.

- Designed **multi-user networking features** using Photon Fusion, enabling real-time collaboration in XR environments.
- Enhanced radargram visualization with **3D digital elevation models (DEMs)** and interactive measurement tools, providing researchers with detailed geospatial insights.
- Developed intuitive user interfaces, including a **login system** and **customizable avatars**, to improve accessibility and engagement.
- Ensured device compatibility across platforms, including the **Oculus Quest** and **Microsoft HoloLens**.

**Impact:**  
This research introduced innovative approaches to collaborative geospatial data analysis, improving workflow efficiency and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration.

### **Research Assistant**  
**Columbia University – Center for Smart City Scapes**  
*May 2024 – Present*

In collaboration with community stakeholders, I worked on an **Augmented Reality (AR)** application to preserve the cultural and historical significance of the Harlem region. The project combined **community storytelling** with modern AR technologies to enhance civic engagement.

- Conducted **field studies** and **archival research** to identify key landmarks and cultural narratives.
- Designed **multi-layered wireframes** in Figma to prototype storytelling features and interactive heatmaps.
- Prototyped AR features in Unity, allowing users to leave comments, AR assets, and stories tied to locations.
- Facilitated pilot studies to collect user feedback, refining the application based on community input.

**Impact:**  
The project empowered local residents to preserve their cultural heritage and enabled an immersive, educational platform for discovering Harlem’s rich history.
