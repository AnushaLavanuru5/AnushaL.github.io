I’m Anusha Lavanuru, a Master’s student in Computer Science at Columbia University. I will be graduating in Dec 2024. My journey in technology began with a tour of ISRO’s satellite launchpad, sparking my passion for innovation at the intersection of math, logic, and automation. With experience in cutting-edge research and software development, I aim to create impactful solutions that advance the boundaries of technology. 

**I am actively looking for SDE, SWE, AR/VR roles**

Academic Background
------
My educational journey began at Zion Matriculation Higher Secondary School in Chennai, India, where I laid a strong foundation for my academic pursuits. I continued my secondary education at Narayana Junior College in Hyderabad, India, excelling in my studies and developing a passion for computer science.

I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Technology (Computer Science) from Gokaraju Rangaraju Institute of Engineering and Technology, where I graduated as the college topper with merit. My undergraduate coursework included foundational and advanced topics such as Algorithms, Programming (C, C++, Java, Python), Advanced Databases, Unix/Linux, Operating Systems, and Compiler Design. This rigorous curriculum, combined with my determination, shaped my technical expertise and problem-solving skills.

To further deepen my knowledge and specialize in cutting-edge fields, I chose to pursue a Master of Science in Computer Science at Columbia University, New York. My coursework at Columbia spans diverse and exciting areas such as Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR), Algorithms, Data Visualization, and UI Design. In addition to my studies, I have been privileged to contribute as a Teaching Assistant for courses like Python for Data Analysis, UI Design, and Databases, which has further enhanced my skills and reinforced my passion for mentoring and collaboration.

This academic journey has been instrumental in preparing me to tackle complex challenges, drive innovation, and make meaningful contributions in the field of computer science.

Personal Motivation
------
My fascination with technology began at the age of 14 when I had the extraordinary opportunity to visit the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) during Space Week. At that time, I had little knowledge of how technology was shaping the world around us. However, the experience of touring ISRO's facilities left an indelible mark on me. I was mesmerized by the launchpads, rocket components, and automated factories where precision engineering brought machines to life. Watching massive systems working seamlessly to execute complex tasks and seeing scientists in observatory centers tracking rocket trajectories was awe-inspiring. This was my first glimpse into the power of technology and automation, and it sparked a profound curiosity about how computers could be programmed to achieve extraordinary outcomes.

This pivotal moment ignited my desire to delve deeper into Computer Science. I became determined to understand the science behind automation and how it could be harnessed to solve real-world problems. Over the years, this curiosity has evolved into a steadfast ambition to create solutions that improve lives, enhance accessibility, and address complex global challenges.

As I advanced in my education, I discovered my passion for fields like Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Human-Computer Interaction. These disciplines resonate deeply with my goal of building systems that are not only innovative but also impactful. Whether it's designing accessible interfaces for people with physical challenges or developing data-driven models to optimize processes, my motivation stems from the desire to use technology as a force for good.

My journey has taught me that technology, at its core, is about empowerment—empowering individuals, communities, and industries to achieve what was once thought impossible. With every project I undertake, I am reminded of the spark that ISRO lit within me and how it continues to drive my quest to explore the endless possibilities of Computer Science.


Current work
------
At Columbia University, my work is centered around research and innovation. I am currently a Research Assistant for two labs: the Computer Enabled Abilities Laboratory, where I develop immersive AR solutions to enhance accessibility and preserve community history, and the Computer Graphics and User Interfaces Lab, where I focus on geospatial data visualization and bridging 2D and 3D environments for XR applications. These experiences have allowed me to work with technologies like Unity, Blender, React, Java, and RESTful APIs.

In addition to research, I have contributed to various Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) projects, exploring applications such as gesture recognition and credit risk assessment. My passion for combining technical knowledge and creativity drives my work in these areas.

During the Summer of 2024, I gained industry experience as a Software Development Engineer Intern at a fintech startup. There, I built dynamic React components, optimized performance using state management tools, and automated invoice processing with an OCR-based system, streamlining workflows for credit evaluation.
