Personal Motivation
------
My fascination with technology began at the age of 14 when I had the extraordinary opportunity to visit the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) during Space Week. At that time, I had little knowledge of how technology was shaping the world around us. However, the experience of touring ISRO's facilities left an indelible mark on me. I was mesmerized by the launchpads, rocket components, and automated factories where precision engineering brought machines to life. Watching massive systems working seamlessly to execute complex tasks and seeing scientists in observatory centers tracking rocket trajectories was awe-inspiring. This was my first glimpse into the power of technology and automation, and it sparked a profound curiosity about how computers could be programmed to achieve extraordinary outcomes.

This pivotal moment ignited my desire to delve deeper into Computer Science. I became determined to understand the science behind automation and how it could be harnessed to solve real-world problems. Over the years, this curiosity has evolved into a steadfast ambition to create solutions that improve lives, enhance accessibility, and address complex global challenges.

As I advanced in my education, I discovered my passion for fields like Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Human-Computer Interaction. These disciplines resonate deeply with my goal of building systems that are not only innovative but also impactful. Whether it's designing accessible interfaces for people with physical challenges or developing data-driven models to optimize processes, my motivation stems from the desire to use technology as a force for good.

My journey has taught me that technology, at its core, is about empowerment—empowering individuals, communities, and industries to achieve what was once thought impossible. With every project I undertake, I am reminded of the spark that ISRO lit within me and how it continues to drive my quest to explore the endless possibilities of Computer Science.


Current work
------
At Columbia University, my work is centered around research and innovation. I am currently a Research Assistant for two labs: the Computer Enabled Abilities Laboratory, where I develop immersive AR solutions to enhance accessibility and preserve community history, and the Computer Graphics and User Interfaces Lab, where I focus on geospatial data visualization and bridging 2D and 3D environments for XR applications. These experiences have allowed me to work with technologies like Unity, Blender, React, Java, and RESTful APIs.

In addition to research, I have contributed to various Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) projects, exploring applications such as gesture recognition and credit risk assessment. My passion for combining technical knowledge and creativity drives my work in these areas.

During the Summer of 2024, I gained industry experience as a Software Development Engineer Intern at a fintech startup. There, I built dynamic React components, optimized performance using state management tools, and automated invoice processing with an OCR-based system, streamlining workflows for credit evaluation.

This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
