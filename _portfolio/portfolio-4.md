Overview
---
EmoVerse is an Augmented Reality (AR) application designed to promote emotional well-being by enabling users to externalize, share, and interact with emotions in a virtual space. Targeted at addressing academic stress among university students, EmoVerse leverages AR technology to foster asynchronous emotional sharing and create a supportive community.

Key features
---
- **Emotion Externalization**: Users create AR objects representing their emotions, paired with descriptive text to provide context.
- **Interactive Emotion Sharing**: Emotions can be placed in the AR environment, where other users can interact with them through actions like touching or poking.
- **Community Support**: Responses to emotions are logged as threads, forming a collaborative emotional journey.
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Facilitates delayed yet meaningful emotional exchanges, making support accessible at any time.

Tech Stack
---
- **Platform**: Augmented Reality using tools like Luma.
- **Prototype Design**: Figma for user interface design and prototyping.
- **Backend and User Study Tools**: Email-based wizard-of-oz setup for testing interactions.

Project highlights
---
- Conducted a user study that demonstrated reduced stress, anxiety, and negative moods among participants after using EmoVerse.
- Designed a prototype emphasizing personalized AR emotions, interactive support threads, and customizable user settings.
- Received qualitative feedback highlighting the importance of descriptive text, the emotional impact of supportive messages, and the novelty of AR-based emotional sharing.

Applications
---
- Aimed at promoting mental health among students through reflective and interactive emotional sharing.
