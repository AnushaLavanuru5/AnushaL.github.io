Overview
---
Developed a machine learning model leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to enhance the visual quality of images. This project focused on improving image sharpness, contrast, and brightness, creating high-quality outputs from low-resolution or noisy images.

Key Features
---
- Used Two-Way GANs with U-Net architecture to achieve superior image enhancement results.
- Integrated global feature extraction to improve scene classification and image structure.
- Improved training stability using Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) and adaptive weighted schemes for faster convergence.

Applications
---
- Enhancing photos for professional and social media use.
- Potential use in the medical field for detailed imaging and cell structure analysis.
- Beneficial for underwater imagery and low-light video processing.

Tech Stack:
---
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: TensorFlow, OpenCV, Keras
- **Tools**: PyCharm, Anaconda
- **Dataset**: MIT-Adobe 5K Dataset

Project highlights
---
- Achieved significant improvement in PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio), showcasing enhanced image quality.
- Designed a U-Net generator with a novel approach to integrate local and global features for better accuracy.
- Used batch normalization to optimize GAN performance and reduce training errors

Future Scope
---
- Explore advanced neural networks to improve SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Measure).
- Extend the model to support video enhancement for real-time applications.
- Develop a mobile application to automate image enhancement based on user preferences.
